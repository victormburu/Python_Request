## 📄 `README.md` — Python `requests` Module Basics

# 🐍 Python Requests Module Practice

This repository documents my practical learning journey using the `requests` library in Python. It covers key HTTP methods, authentication, parameters, JSON parsing, file writing, and understanding response objects.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

### ✅ Basic GET Request

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
print(response.status_code)  # 200
```

---

### 🔐 GET with Basic Authentication

```python
response = requests.get(
    'https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/victor/great',
    auth=('victor', 'great')
)
print(response.status_code)  # 200
print(response.json())  # {'authenticated': True, 'user': 'victor'}
```

---

### 📩 POST Request with Payload

```python
payload = {'username': 'victor', 'password': 'great'}
response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
r_dict = response.json()
print(r_dict['form'])  # {'username': 'victor', 'password': 'great'}
```

---

### 📂 Query Parameters in URL (GET)

```python
payload = {'username': 'victor', 'password': 'great'}
response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)
print(response.url)
```

---

### 📁 Saving Binary Data (e.g., Image)

```python
response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/image/png')
with open('httpbin_image.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

---

### 📬 Response Attributes

* `response.status_code`: HTTP status code
* `response.text`: Text response
* `response.content`: Raw binary content
* `response.json()`: Parsed JSON (if applicable)
* `response.headers`: HTTP headers
* `dir(response)`: Inspect available methods and attributes
* `help(response)`: Full documentation of the response object

---

### ⏱ Timeout Handling

```python
requests.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/5', timeout=3)  # Raises Timeout if >3 sec
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

These are essential skills for working with APIs, automation, and data retrieval. This foundation sets me up to:

* Interact with REST APIs (GET, POST)
* Secure API requests (Basic Auth)
* Handle files and JSON
* Build automation scripts
* Connect APIs to data pipelines and dashboards (e.g., Metabase, Power BI)

---

## 🔗 Useful Resources

* [Python Requests Docs](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* [HTTPBin for testing](https://httpbin.org/)
* [Postman to test APIs visually](https://www.postman.com/)

---

## 📌 Next Goals

* Practice with real-world APIs (CoinGecko, OpenWeather)
* Automate data collection to a database
* Connect APIs to BI dashboards
